**Introduction**
This project aims to generate daily baseball game predictions using advanced statistical and machine learning models. The scripts provided analyze historical data to forecast game outcomes, offering insights for sports analytics and betting strategies.

**#System Requirements**
Programming Language: R (version 4.0.5 or later)
Required Libraries: retrosheet, baseballDBR, baseballr, splitstackshape, lubridate, tidyr, dplyr, stringr, xgboost, SHAPforxgboost, zoo, caret, skimr, readr, tidyverse
Development Environment: The scripts are designed to be run in an R Markdown environment that supports HTML output.
Installation
Install R from CRAN.

**Open R and install the necessary libraries using:**
R
install.packages(c("retrosheet", "baseballDBR", "baseballr", "splitstackshape", "lubridate", "tidyr", "dplyr", "stringr", "xgboost", "SHAPforxgboost", "zoo", "caret", "skimr", "readr", "tidyverse"))

**#Usage**
To run the daily prediction script:

**#Open the ML_bet.rmd file in RStudio or another compatible IDE.**
Run the chunks sequentially to generate the predictions for the day's games.
Review the HTML output for the analysis and predictions.
